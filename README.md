# Star-Wars-RPG

This is an RPG game created to develop and demonstrate object oriented design.

#How to Play

On load, the user should select the character they want to play with. Each character has an attack power, a defense power, and hit points

Once user selects a character, they will fight through all of the remaining characters. Every time the user attacks, their attack power will increase by the amount of their initial attack power (Attack power of 10 will become 20, 30 etc.) If the user defeats an enemy he can select the next one, but if the enemy surives the attack, he will counter-attack with their defense power.

The enemies to fight should be chosen in a strategic order in order to complete the game. It is possible to win or lose the game with any character depending on the order of enemies selected.
